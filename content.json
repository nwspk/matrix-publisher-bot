Is it shared membership, or shared responsibility?\n\nI’ve been thinking a lot about the engagement of the cohort and why I feel upset when people disengage. Perhaps it’s a personal thing, such as a feeling of abandoned.\n\nWhen I really consider that, however, it’s more complex. The fellowship, to me, was a sort of group project to build and govern a small community that is, as Ed often says, like a small country. I believe communities require stewardship, care, explicit communications, discomfort (because we can build anything if we are all comfortable), and collective responsibility.However, the format by which our cohort is running (in some ways by “default”) - with fluid responsibility and not accountability, to me feels like… the anthithesis to how I implicitly understand communities to be built.\n\nBetrayal is not the right word here, but I certainly feel that when no one is “required” to steward and no one “owes” each other anything, then we can’t build a community we actually want to be a part of, that requires intentional work.It’s a complex feeling. I empathize with the reasons for disengaging while also feel hurt by the “dropping of the group project”.Is this grief that the shared project is being abandoned? Grief for the version of the cohort I imagined you we could potentially build together where we would get past the everyday polices that we know to be unhelpful (like codes of conduct) and reimagine what those systems could look like with a new lens to take back to the real world?\n\nI’m trying to decouple my instinct to hold the community together from my excitement about the fellowship itself, but I suspect people like me will always yearn for communities where everyone is bought in.Maybe learning to take small steps… and confronting how people actually engage is part of this political education and I just don’t see it because I’m in it.And there may still be ways for the core group to model community with more structure or experimentation.\n\nHow do I keep modeling the kind of community I believe in, while also protecting myself from “hurt” and accepting that people will engage at their own limits and that this, too, is part of… politics?",

I believe communities require stewardship, care, explicit communications, discomfort (because we can build anything if we are all comfortable), and collective responsibility.However, the format by which our cohort is running (in some ways by “default”) - with fluid responsibility and not accountability, to me feels like… the anthithesis to how I implicitly understand communities to be built.</p>\n<p>Betrayal is not the right word here, but I certainly feel that when no one is “required” to steward and no one “owes” each other anything, then we can’t build a community we actually want to be a part of, that requires intentional work.It’s a complex feeling. I empathize with the reasons for disengaging while also feel hurt by the “dropping of the group project”.Is this grief that the shared project is being abandoned? Grief for the version of the cohort I imagined you we could potentially build together where we would get past the everyday polices that we know to be unhelpful (like codes of conduct) and reimagine what those systems could look like with a new lens to take back to the real world?</p>\n<p>I’m trying to decouple my instinct to hold the community together from my excitement about the fellowship itself, but I suspect people like me will always yearn for communities where everyone is bought in.Maybe learning to take small steps… and confronting how people actually engage is part of this political education and I just don’t see it because I’m in it.And there may still be ways for the core group to model community with more structure or experimentation.</p>\n<p>How do I keep modeling the kind of community I believe in, while also protecting myself from “hurt” and accepting that people will engage at their own limits and that this, too, is part of… politics?</p>\n"

      "body": "---\n\n### 📔 Field Note: On the legitimacy of the governance module\n\nThis has been sitting with me since before the governance retrospective, but even more so since then that clarifies why I keep feeling “stuck”.\n\nWhen I talk about experiments in the governance module, especially the idea of temporarily assigning authority or playing with rules, I often hear some version of:\n\n> “Even if you were dictator and there was a signed charter, why would we follow the rules?”\n\nIt’s usually said in good faith, sometimes even in good faith debate. When I push on this, my allies in the house say, “well that’s life” or “well that’s politics”\n\nIs it? I’ve been trying to understand why this answer feels unsatisfying to me. This isn’t the politics that I came to practice at the house, this is the politics of convincing people that the legitimacy and value of a thing that I thought they already had bought into.\n\nI came into this fellowship believing that opting in meant opting into the governance module, that we were agreeing, as a collective, by the rules we would design, test, contest, and revise together. I thought that engagement, at the very least was required, not agreement. But other cohort members seem to have opted into a much narrower version of the fellowship: shared house, shared conversations, and this optional play in the sandbox that can’t ever _really_ constrain them.\n\nThose are very different constitutional assumptions.\n\nWhat I’m noticing is that we keep trying to debate _policies_ without ever settling what would make a rule binding in the first place.

It was **handoff**.\n\nThat caught my attention.\n\nBy handoff, I don’t mean chaining prompts or passing outputs. I mean the transfer of state, intent, assumptions, and responsibility from one agent to another. Not just “here’s the result”, but “here’s why this work exists, what constraints matter, and what you now own”.\n\nMost multi-agent systems don’t really do that. They pass artifacts such as text, summaries, tool outputs and expect the next agent to infer the rest. That inference step is where things become fragile. At first this feels like a gap, but looking closer, it seems more like deliberate design.\n\nThis is where context engineering keeps coming up for me, not as prompt tuning but as a systems constraint. As systems grow, no single agent can hold the full picture. Instead of trying to move full context, intent, and responsibility between agents, most systems centralize those things elsewhere.\n\n[Anthropic’s multi-agent research system](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/multi-agent-research-system) is a useful example here. Their setup relies on an orchestrator agent to plan the work, decompose queries, spin up parallel researchers, and integrate the results. Intent, assumptions, and responsibility are held centrally and re-expressed at each step when they're passed to the next agent. Tools like LangGraph or Agent Squad also do so by centralizing intent and control rather than enabling agents to hand work to each other directly.\n\nSo I guess the hard part of multi-agent systems isn’t getting agents to do work. Execution is the easy bit. The hard part is everything that happens _between_ agents. Rather than solving agent-to-agent handoff directly, today’s systems avoid it by routing all coordination through orchestrators as a central point.\n\nThere’s a similar pattern with evaluation. Letting agents critique or evaluate other agents can scale quality control, and LLM-as-judge approaches will work well when they’re designed well. Evaluation only works because intent and constraints are held outside the agents themselves. Without that central context, evaluation risks optimizing for surface correctness rather than whether the system is actually doing the right thing.\n\nProtocols like MCP help standardize how agents access tools and shared state, but they don’t really solve handoff either. They make context accessible, not transferable. Intent, assumptions, and responsibility still live in orchestrators, glue code, or prompt conventions.\n\nI’m left with a few open questions:\n\n- What is the smallest amount of context that is actually needed to hand off from agent to agent?\n- Is centralized orchestration a temporary solution, are there alternatives?\n- Are there existing systems (or papers) that attempt agent-to-agent handoff of intent or ownership, and where do they break down in practice?\n- This makes me wonder whether some of the challenge behaviors in agentic systems may be happening in the orchestration layer.",

      "body": "### 📔 **Field Note: When Optimism Feels Like a Social Risk**\n\nThis has been sitting with me for weeks. After conversations with Ed and faculty, it’s gotten sharper, but I’m still not sure what this experience really is, or whether it has political viability.\n\nThere’s a thing that happens in groups that I care about where critique becomes the dominant point of conversation. Not critique as analysis or disagreement, but critique as posture, where the “system” we exist in whether that’s the cohort or an open source team, is fundamentally broken, the powers that be are “irredeemable” and nothing short of total rejection is acceptable.\n\nAnd I find that in groups like these, over time, there’s a hostility to hope.\n\nAs someone who tries to cradle a tiny flame of optimism, I find it challenged as naivety. Attempts to contextualize, or to reason about what might still be possible, the opportunity space ahead of us, are met with suspicion or ridicule as a gut reaction.\n\nI’ve also encountered this in open source communities I’ve volunteered in. Once an “enemy” of sorts is established, it becomes a very tricky operation to propose any kind of compromise without looking complicit. But without compromise, nothing actually resolves. Volunteers get no closure. The community can’t move forward in a way that preserves the sustainability of either the people or the project.\n\nThis dynamic seems to find me in every group, team, or company I’m part of (or perhaps it is a pattern that I find myself drawn to as a result of caring for the building of communities?) And it crushes my hope. Not because I disagree with the critique, I often share it, but because there’s no room left for action. There’s no space to be curious, to imagine moving forward, to repair, iterate, or make partial progress. The only acceptable stance seems to be collective fatalism.\n\nMost recently, I feel this in my sense of purpose in the fellowship. I’m here because I believe deeply in the vision, in building, testing, and intervening in systems and experiments that I know have failed me in the real world, and through that, learning politics by doing. But when optimism becomes socially risky, I start to feel like I don’t fit, like I need to shrink my hopes and ambitions to meet the moment.\n\nIf I’m lucky, there are people who replenish my optimism, because they, too, feel unheard and feel the weight of the current political situation pressing on them. The Americans in the cohort, for example, share a kind of implicit understanding of purpose. They understand this political moment, sense that something is shifting, and feel called, like I do, to do more. Those conversations restore my energy and clarity. They remind me why I care and why I moved my entire life to be here. But when I feel replenished and return to conversations at the house, the group norm reasserts itself. I find myself grasping at the threads of hope I had so carefully braided earlier that week, or even earlier that day.\n\nWhat makes this especially difficult is that I care deeply about the individuals in this group. Their opinions and feelings matter to me. I want to stay engaged, and leaving feels like abandonment or like minimizing their pain. This in-between space is really a rocky road and I find myself feeling drained more often than I am replenished. I also don't want to withdraw entirely.\n\nIn the past, I’ve only been “successful” in navigating this when I was given a clear charter of power. In open source, that meant asking maintainers to step away when their positions were no longer serving them or the project, especially when they were silencing newer, curious voices who wanted to work rather than only critique. In corporate environments, it meant reassigning responsibilities and holding people accountable for the work they were meant to do. In situations like this where I didn't have agency to change anything, I usually burned out trying to recapture my hope week after week and eventually left the organization.\n\nMaybe that’s the only way I know how to handle this. Or maybe there are other routes, working at the individual level, explicitly building a group of people who still have hope, and naming what’s happening out loud so we can refill each other’s energy intentionally.\n\nBeing able to name this pattern feels important. If I can see it clearly, maybe I can build a skill for living with it or intervening without losing my hope next time.\n\nOpen questions:\n\n•\tHow do groups reset norms once they’ve drifted this way?\n\n•\tWhat are the early signs that you're headed this way?\n\n•\tAt what point does naming harm stop creating capacity and start eroding it?",

After conversations with Ed and faculty, it’s gotten sharper, but I’m still not sure what this experience really is, or whether it has political viability.</p>\n<p>There’s a thing that happens in groups that I care about where critique becomes the dominant point of conversation. Not critique as analysis or disagreement, but critique as posture, where the “system” we exist in whether that’s the cohort or an open source team, is fundamentally broken, the powers that be are “irredeemable” and nothing short of total rejection is acceptable.</p>\n<p>And I find that in groups like these, over time, there’s a hostility to hope.</p>\n<p>As someone who tries to cradle a tiny flame of optimism, I find it challenged as naivety. Attempts to contextualize, or to reason about what might still be possible, the opportunity space ahead of us, are met with suspicion or ridicule as a gut reaction.</p>\n<p>I’ve also encountered this in open source communities I’ve volunteered in. Once an “enemy” of sorts is established, it becomes a very tricky operation to propose any kind of compromise without looking complicit. But without compromise, nothing actually resolves. Volunteers get no closure. The community can’t move forward in a way that preserves the sustainability of either the people or the project.</p>\n<p>This dynamic seems to find me in every group, team, or company I’m part of (or perhaps it is a pattern that I find myself drawn to as a result of caring for the building of communities?) And it crushes my hope. Not because I disagree with the critique, I often share it, but because there’s no room left for action. There’s no space to be curious, to imagine moving forward, to repair, iterate, or make partial progress. The only acceptable stance seems to be collective fatalism.</p>\n<p>Most recently, I feel this in my sense of purpose in the fellowship. I’m here because I believe deeply in the vision, in building, testing, and intervening in systems and experiments that I know have failed me in the real world, and through that, learning politics by doing. But when optimism becomes socially risky, I start to feel like I don’t fit, like I need to shrink my hopes and ambitions to meet the moment.</p>\n<p>If I’m lucky, there are people who replenish my optimism, because they, too, feel unheard and feel the weight of the current political situation pressing on them. The Americans in the cohort, for example, share a kind of implicit understanding of purpose. They understand this political moment, sense that something is shifting, and feel called, like I do, to do more. Those conversations restore my energy and clarity. They remind me why I care and why I moved my entire life to be here. But when I feel replenished and return to conversations at the house, the group norm reasserts itself. I find myself grasping at the threads of hope I had so carefully braided earlier that week, or even earlier that day.</p>\n<p>What makes this especially difficult is that I care deeply about the individuals in this group. Their opinions and feelings matter to me. I want to stay engaged, and leaving feels like abandonment or like minimizing their pain. This in-between space is really a rocky road and I find myself feeling drained more often than I am replenished. I also don't want to withdraw entirely.</p>\n<p>In the past, I’ve only been “successful” in navigating this when I was given a clear charter of power. In open source, that meant asking maintainers to step away when their positions were no longer serving them or the project, especially when they were silencing newer, curious voices who wanted to work rather than only critique. In corporate environments, it meant reassigning responsibilities and holding people accountable for the work they were meant to do. In situations like this where I didn't have agency to change anything, I usually burned out trying to recapture my hope week after week and eventually left the organization.</p>\n<p>Maybe that’s the only way I know how to handle this. Or maybe there are other routes, working at the individual level, explicitly building a group of people who still have hope, and naming what’s happening out loud so we can refill each other’s energy intentionally.</p>\n<p>Being able to name this pattern feels important. If I can see it clearly, maybe I can build a skill for living with it or intervening without losing my hope next time.</p>\n<p>Open questions:</p>\n<p>•\tHow do groups reset norms once they’ve drifted this way?</p>\n<p>•\tWhat are the early signs that you're headed this way?</p>\n<p>•\tAt what point does naming harm stop creating capacity and start eroding it?</p>\n"

      "body": "## 📔 Field Note: Before we come for Managers, we need to look at Organizations\n\nI suppose the purpose of this class session was \"Do we still Managers?\" and will AI replace them? I fully expected Peyman to present us with question early on. Instead, we dove into the meta a bit. Before we can really analyze the role of managers in organizations, need to talk about organizations themselves - and how they evolve (and sometimes don't).\n\n### organizational paradigms\n\nIn “[Reinventing Organizations](http://www.reinventingorganizations.com/?utm_source=newsletter&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=work_week_41_2018_three_categories_of_human_organizations&utm_term=2018-10-12)”, author Frederic Laloux writes that “_\\[a\\]n organization cannot evolve beyond its leadership’s stage of \\[consciousness\\]._” He describes specific stages of organizational paradigms:\n\n- **Red** - organizations ruled with a absolute power, limited to the immediate reach and influence of their leader. Red organizations are often described as wolf packs or the mafia. Everyone is motivated by fear, change is management can happen through a change in power dynamics.\n- **Amber** - organizations with a top down conformist structure of power with rigid stages of management and hierarchies to pass down stable, replicable processes to large groups of people. Consider the Catholic Church or an army.\n- **Orange** - typical organizations that make decisions based on evidence, acting like machines - setting goals, breaking those into benchmarks or OKRS, and then working towards them. These goals can be driven by shareholder value for example. Most companies exist at this orange stage.\n- **Green** - a newer model for organizations that is values driven, with a culture of empowerment, multi stakeholders that share in decisions and benefits of those decisions. Individuals in these organizations are able to drive things forward.\n- **Teal** - is an evolutionary model for organizations - where everyone is a manager, and everyone has the autonomy and authority to fix issues themselves. Distributed, remote teams are in a key position to take advantage of this new model, because the architecture and real estate of a physical workspace can’t play into reinforcing a hierarchy.\n\nWhat struck me about this analysis of organizational paradigms was slotting in the organizations that I've worked for and reflecting on how they've moved along the scale - which is certainly not linear. Because in every organization, there are pockets of teal - where employees have autonomy and authority to act, vs pockets of red - where a VP might have absolute power, say, and control. I also considered the fact that organizations don't always evolve forward, they often regress.\n\nUnder the pressure of the market, scarce resources, or industry's rapid change, even mature green organizations can slide back into tightly controlled, slower decision processes, and higher amounts of centralization. For example, towards an IPO, even the employees with the most autonomy might find themselves following beauocratic hierarchical processes due to compliance needs.\n\nA question that was posed in class was -  _**in a genuinely good culture or system, can you leave it up to people to decide what they should do?**_ this is an interesting one to think about in reference to AI agents and the future of work.\n\n### organizational reshuffles\n\nOrganisational reshuffles is also an interesting lens here. When structures change, people often _rethink the organisation itself,_ its values, its rules, what is actually allowed. That moment of ambiguity can feel destabilising, but it might also be one of the few times real reflection becomes possible. Space to rethink isn’t always a failure mode; sometimes it’s the point.\n\n### activity - management activities\n\nWe ran an activity in class: list “management activities” and then sort them into categories:\n\nthings that don’t need management at all, things that are necessary and centralized, things that may be necessary depending on context, and things that aren’t necessary.\n\nThe exercise quietly dismantled the idea that “management” is a single role. Instead, it’s a bundle of functions, some structural, some cultural, some political. And some bundles of tasks, we found over discussion, weren't even necessary for the manager to do.\n\n**Doesn’t have to be management**\n* Organising product\n* Project management (doesn’t need to be centralised)\n* Time allocation\n* Initiative / experimentation\n\n**Necessary and centralised**\n* Consensus mechanisms\n* Policy enforcement\n* Core strategy / value-setting (emerging core strategy / value team)\n\n**Can be necessary (context-dependent)**\n* Product management (depends on scale and cross-functionality)\n* Project management (varies by context)\n* Governance under scarcity\n* Resource prioritisation during limited resources or reshuffles\n\n**Not necessary**\n* Vision setting\n* “Corporate BS”\n\nThis is where the fantasy of fully distributed, future-leaning teams started to fray. Many such models assume abundance: enough time, enough money, enough attention. In reality, teams operate under limited resources. You can decentralise how people allocate their time, but the _consensus mechanisms_ - what ultimately gets prioritised, funded, or enforced - often remain centralised. Scarcity pulls authority back toward the centre.\n\nProduct and project management surfaced as examples. In theory, they could be decentralized. In practice, they rarely are, especially when dependencies stack up. Policy enforcement, even more so, tends to centralize by necessity. This isn’t a moral failure; it’s an organizational gravity well.\n\n#### culture vs process\n\nThat tension showed up again in the discussion of culture versus process. Is it more important to have a handbook, or an open form of discussion? A static policy, or a living document? The more interesting framing wasn’t either/or, but _what the handbook actually does_. Handbooks are often ignored and yet they generate discussion. People argue with them, interpret them, feel constrained or protected by them. Their real value may lie less in compliance and more in the sense-making they provoke.\n\nWhich leads to a harder question: **is there a level of discomfort we should be willing to tolerate in order to create the change we say we want?**\n\nExpense policies is another example. Clear rules can feel restrictive, but they also reduce ambiguity and unfairness. Looser, emergent norms can feel freer, but risk uneven application and hidden power. Is it possible to evolve policies that are flexible _and_ fair, freer in practice, without abandoning guidance or reasonableness?\n\n### bias for action\n\nWanting people to try things and learn from attempts isn’t enough. You have to make it _successful to try_. Bias for action turns out to be a skill, not a slogan and it has maturity levels. At its best, it looks like controlled experimentation, not reckless motion. It requires scaffolding.\n\n#### python vs C\n\nTo illustrate this situation, let's take a look at two programming languages.\n\nPython encourages action: forgiving defaults, fast feedback, easy rollback.\n\nC demands precision, upfront correctness, and carries higher consequences for mistakes.\n\nNeither is inherently better (although you might find that enthusiasts disagree with this take) but they produce very different behaviors. Organizations, like languages, encode values into their constraints.\n\nSome conditions for a healthy bias-for-action culture are:\n\n- fast feedback mechanisms and rollback paths,\n- well-understood impact and blast radius,\n- frameworks for experimentation with explicit gates for lower risk,\n- and crucially, structure even in “permission-less” environments.\n\n#### permission-less cultures\n\nI probably need a whole separate field note on permission-less cultures, because I don't believe they exist - and it hit close to home. Trying to be action-oriented without clear boundaries often creates _more_ ambiguity, not less. Even anarchist systems have rules. “No permission needed” still requires shared understanding of limits.\n\nThe phrase “go and act” came up repeatedly,  mostly as a warning. It doesn’t work. For many people, playing it safe is more natural, especially in civic or institutional contexts where failure carries reputational or moral weight. Even with frameworks in place, acting can feel risky.\n\nSo the real challenge becomes perceptual: **how do you show people that the risk is actually small?** Could you test something in one year instead of three? Can you make reversibility visible? Signals matter and organizations are constantly sending them, often unintentionally.\n\n#### culture change takes time\n\nFinally, culture change takes time. It takes months for an organization to acclimate to a new culture and it happens very, very slowly. Institutional safety and psychological safety are distinct but intertwined. And that global contexts complicate everything  what feels safe, fast, or acceptable in one region may not in another.\n\nI left class with the sense that the real question isn’t whether we still need managers, but **what managers are actually for**. If autonomy is the goal, someone still has to design the conditions that make autonomy survivable. Goals, values, guardrails, feedback loops, this is the work that doesn’t disappear just because hierarchy does.\n\nIn the next class, we will take a deeper look at the goals, values, and conditions for bias for action, empowerment - and whether managers are no longer needed if processes can be decentralized.",

      "formatted_body": "<h2>📔 Field Note: Before we come for Managers, we need to look at Organizations</h2>\n<p>I suppose the purpose of this class session was \"Do we still Managers?\" and will AI replace them? I fully expected Peyman to present us with question early on. Instead, we dove into the meta a bit. Before we can really analyze the role of managers in organizations, need to talk about organizations themselves - and how they evolve (and sometimes don't).</p>\n<h3>organizational paradigms</h3>\n<p>In “<a href=\"http://www.reinventingorganizations.com/?utm_source=newsletter&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=work_week_41_2018_three_categories_of_human_organizations&amp;utm_term=2018-10-12\">Reinventing Organizations</a>”, author Frederic Laloux writes that “<em>[a]n organization cannot evolve beyond its leadership’s stage of [consciousness].</em>” He describes specific stages of organizational paradigms:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Red</strong> - organizations ruled with a absolute power, limited to the immediate reach and influence of their leader. Red organizations are often described as wolf packs or the mafia. Everyone is motivated by fear, change is management can happen through a change in power dynamics.</li>\n<li><strong>Amber</strong> - organizations with a top down conformist structure of power with rigid stages of management and hierarchies to pass down stable, replicable processes to large groups of people. Consider the Catholic Church or an army.</li>\n<li><strong>Orange</strong> - typical organizations that make decisions based on evidence, acting like machines - setting goals, breaking those into benchmarks or OKRS, and then working towards them. These goals can be driven by shareholder value for example. Most companies exist at this orange stage.</li>\n<li><strong>Green</strong> - a newer model for organizations that is values driven, with a culture of empowerment, multi stakeholders that share in decisions and benefits of those decisions. Individuals in these organizations are able to drive things forward.</li>\n<li><strong>Teal</strong> - is an evolutionary model for organizations - where everyone is a manager, and everyone has the autonomy and authority to fix issues themselves. Distributed, remote teams are in a key position to take advantage of this new model, because the architecture and real estate of a physical workspace can’t play into reinforcing a hierarchy.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>What struck me about this analysis of organizational paradigms was slotting in the organizations that I've worked for and reflecting on how they've moved along the scale - which is certainly not linear. Because in every organization, there are pockets of teal - where employees have autonomy and authority to act, vs pockets of red - where a VP might have absolute power, say, and control. I also considered the fact that organizations don't always evolve forward, they often regress.</p>\n<p>Under the pressure of the market, scarce resources, or industry's rapid change, even mature green organizations can slide back into tightly controlled, slower decision processes, and higher amounts of centralization. For example, towards an IPO, even the employees with the most autonomy might find themselves following beauocratic hierarchical processes due to compliance needs.</p>\n<p>A question that was posed in class was -  <em><strong>in a genuinely good culture or system, can you leave it up to people to decide what they should do?</strong></em> this is an interesting one to think about in reference to AI agents and the future of work.</p>\n<h3>organizational reshuffles</h3>\n<p>Organisational reshuffles is also an interesting lens here. When structures change, people often <em>rethink the organisation itself,</em> its values, its rules, what is actually allowed. That moment of ambiguity can feel destabilising, but it might also be one of the few times real reflection becomes possible. Space to rethink isn’t always a failure mode; sometimes it’s the point.</p>\n<h3>activity - management activities</h3>\n<p>We ran an activity in class: list “management activities” and then sort them into categories:</p>\n<p>things that don’t need management at all, things that are necessary and centralized, things that may be necessary depending on context, and things that aren’t necessary.</p>\n<p>The exercise quietly dismantled the idea that “management” is a single role. Instead, it’s a bundle of functions, some structural, some cultural, some political. And some bundles of tasks, we found over discussion, weren't even necessary for the manager to do.</p>\n<p><strong>Doesn’t have to be management</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Organising product</li>\n<li>Project management (doesn’t need to be centralised)</li>\n<li>Time allocation</li>\n<li>Initiative / experimentation</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Necessary and centralised</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Consensus mechanisms</li>\n<li>Policy enforcement</li>\n<li>Core strategy / value-setting (emerging core strategy / value team)</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Can be necessary (context-dependent)</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Product management (depends on scale and cross-functionality)</li>\n<li>Project management (varies by context)</li>\n<li>Governance under scarcity</li>\n<li>Resource prioritisation during limited resources or reshuffles</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Not necessary</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Vision setting</li>\n<li>“Corporate BS”</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This is where the fantasy of fully distributed, future-leaning teams started to fray. Many such models assume abundance: enough time, enough money, enough attention. In reality, teams operate under limited resources. You can decentralise how people allocate their time, but the <em>consensus mechanisms</em> - what ultimately gets prioritised, funded, or enforced - often remain centralised. Scarcity pulls authority back toward the centre.</p>\n<p>Product and project management surfaced as examples. In theory, they could be decentralized.

The `Decode Taiwan Open Tech: Open source and civic tech meetup in London for latest communities updates from Taiwan` immediately caught my eye and as I expected, both g0v and Open Culture Foundation were mentioned in the description.\n\nThis really took me back - and it further reinforced why this institution is so unique and brings together so many communities that overlap and do similar kinds of work.\n\nWhen I first started out in Civic Tech in New York City, I volunteered at Personal Democracy Forum for a ticket to the conference. I was often assigned the role of greeting and guiding speakers. In 2017, 2-3 years into my early journey of civic tech - I'd come in from Boston, where I was working for the Digital Team, to volunteer.

I was an absolute fan girl and the whole interaction was a blur.\n\nLater that day, sitting in the audience - in the gallery above where the volunteers got to look over the stage, I watched - mesmerized as Audrey Tang delivered her keynote - \"STORIES FROM FROM THE FUTURE OF DEMOCRACY: TAIWAN\" describing the digital ministry's efforts to pioneer \"digital democracy\", using polis for civic participation and strategies for combatting disinformation.\n\nI was absolutely enamored with the whole thing - from the digital ministry of taiwan to g0v and their decentralized governance for managing the community.

I reached out to the organizer of the event for a coffee chat - and they were delighted to meet, and even brought some of their friends.\n\nThe coffee chat felt like we'd known each other for years.

      "body": "## 📔  (Rough Draft) Field Note: Reflecting on a Fellowship Where Rules Can Be Rewritten / Who Taught Us the Rules\n\nThe first time that I noticed systems meant to support people in fact actually excluded them was the free lunch in elementary school. In first grade, trying to get a free lunch was a bureaucratic rollercoaster. I felt ashamed that my father had to prove his retirement status and income in order for me to be able to eat lunch at school because we could hardly afford lunch otherwise. So that chocolate milk I had every morning when I arrived, it weighed on me heavily because we had to earn it.\n\nWhy are systems that are meant to support people so difficult to access?\n\nThere is now research that calls this “administrative burden,” the idea that paperwork, verification requirements, and documentation act as gatekeeping mechanisms even in programs designed to support low income families. I did not have that language at the time. I only knew that something about it felt wrong.\n\nCertain systems make it harder for people to access services that they need. And because of the way they are built, people may not even attempt to advocate for themselves.\n\nThis is just one of the patterns I have been reflecting on. Systems that I have observed over the years either include some people and exclude others, add friction to the process for the groups most in need, or create an intimidating process that adds too much cost.\n\nMy parents were immigrants. They emigrated to Canada and then to the United States in the 1960s, and their perspective on how to interact with systems is so different from mine. My father, in particular, saw rules as flexible, power as attainable, and systems that meant to squash the hopes and ideals of immigrants as unnecessary to pay any mind to. He would bend or navigate around systems that didn't serve him.\n\nFor example, he would sign me up for a private elementary school education, negotiate a scholarship that did not exist, and then use my academic abilities to prove it was worth it. He would convince, charm, and negotiate his way into rooms and doors that were historically closed for our people.

This is not about who wins the award. It is about building a system of evaluation. How do we decide, asynchronously and as a committee, what counts as impact and evidence. How do we encode our values into an algorithmic process, with or without AI. And then how do we publicly justify those decisions as part of the system we created to do these evaluations.\n\nThe core of this for me, and the part that hits home the most, is the question of legitimacy.\n\nAs a young girl, I took rules and systems and laws as the highest form of legitimacy possible. I did not believe they could be bent or modified or made an exception to. I watched my father break rules and somehow still get his way. Later in life, I watched senior officials and leadership do the same.\n\nNew systems do not displace old ones simply by being better. They displace them by earning legitimacy.\n\nMost people spend their lives navigating institutions they did not build, arguing within rules they did not write. Here, we are being handed the chance to design systems before they harden.\n\nI sometimes wonder whether that feels different depending on how you grew up. If you were always comfortable inside systems, perhaps designing one does not feel radical. But if you grew up feeling governed by rules you could not bend, watching your family fight administrative friction just to access what was promised to them, then being handed the chance to create rules from scratch feels almost unreal.\n\nAnd even here, we default to precedent. We reproduce familiar hierarchies. We hesitate to truly unsettle inherited logic.\n\nDesigning systems is heavier than criticizing them. It forces the question of authority. What gives us the right to decide what counts. What makes our process legitimate.\n\nThis house gives us something rare. The space to practice constructing legitimacy intentionally.

      "formatted_body": "<h2>📔  (Rough Draft) Field Note: Reflecting on a Fellowship Where Rules Can Be Rewritten / Who Taught Us the Rules</h2>\n<p>The first time that I noticed systems meant to support people in fact actually excluded them was the free lunch in elementary school. In first grade, trying to get a free lunch was a bureaucratic rollercoaster. I felt ashamed that my father had to prove his retirement status and income in order for me to be able to eat lunch at school because we could hardly afford lunch otherwise. So that chocolate milk I had every morning when I arrived, it weighed on me heavily because we had to earn it.</p>\n<p>Why are systems that are meant to support people so difficult to access?</p>\n<p>There is now research that calls this “administrative burden,” the idea that paperwork, verification requirements, and documentation act as gatekeeping mechanisms even in programs designed to support low income families. I did not have that language at the time. I only knew that something about it felt wrong.</p>\n<p>Certain systems make it harder for people to access services that they need. And because of the way they are built, people may not even attempt to advocate for themselves.</p>\n<p>This is just one of the patterns I have been reflecting on. Systems that I have observed over the years either include some people and exclude others, add friction to the process for the groups most in need, or create an intimidating process that adds too much cost.</p>\n<p>My parents were immigrants. They emigrated to Canada and then to the United States in the 1960s, and their perspective on how to interact with systems is so different from mine. My father, in particular, saw rules as flexible, power as attainable, and systems that meant to squash the hopes and ideals of immigrants as unnecessary to pay any mind to. He would bend or navigate around systems that didn't serve him.</p>\n<p>For example, he would sign me up for a private elementary school education, negotiate a scholarship that did not exist, and then use my academic abilities to prove it was worth it. He would convince, charm, and negotiate his way into rooms and doors that were historically closed for our people. Part of it was his ability to present as white passing and his British accent, which made him more palatable to the majority, but the bulk of it was his lived experience. Being the other in so many foreign countries gave him this innate confidence that he was owed power, owed a seat at the table, owed an audience.</p>\n<p>When it came to high school admissions, my neighborhood in Queens was zoned to one school.

The audience was mesmerized. Words like “so truthful,” “objective,” and “work of art” floated around the discussion circle afterwards. People were in awe. They admired the precision of the cuts, the rhythm of the music, and noted that while it used real footage, it still managed to create a plot.\n\nI felt something else.\n\nAbout ten minutes into the film, when the mountains panned into power lines, I almost laughed because at that point it was clear to me what the film was going to present. Before that, I had been curious about the transition and where we were headed. After that, I felt I understood the thesis.\n\nShortly after, the music swells and we end on a family sitting on the sand at the beach, panning out to reveal a looming power plant behind them. I laughed quietly. Not because it was funny, and not to mock the craft, but because it felt like such an obvious rhetorical move.\n\nAs the film continued, I noticed a pattern of selection. When it zoomed in on human faces, they were often wary, blank, or distrustful. There were one or two smiling faces, but they felt incidental. Whenever it showed technology or urban advancement, it paired those images with speed, fast-paced music, and an implication of alienation: people moving urgently through subway stations, streets, or factories.\n\nIt was beautifully crafted. But I felt resistant to what it was trying to do.\n\nIt felt as though the film was asking me to dehumanize these people, to see them as extensions of machines. That was difficult for me. I saw the women placing food onto factory belts sped up 10x and thought about how physically demanding that job must be. I saw people entering subways en masse and remembered how easily I could visit my parents from the city on weekends. I saw highways filled with cars meant to disillusion me, and thought about how, for immigrant families like mine, cars represented economic mobility and access.\n\nThe film seemed to position these advances in ways that encouraged suspicion and critique, while I felt the reality was more nuanced. Have we polluted the earth through industrialism? Yes. But have we also created electronic wheelchairs, video calls, and transit systems that expand freedom and connection? Also yes.\n\nIn the discussion, people insisted the film was neutral because it used real footage. What I felt was resistance.\n\nDoes industrial modernity creates alienation? Yes, it does. Does acceleration destabilize life? Yes, it can.

While watching planes underscored by ominous music, I thought of reunions, migration, expanded worlds. The film abstracted humanity into masses; I hated that.\n\nIn the discussion circle, I felt slightly off. Everyone was in awe of the artistry and the messaging. I briefly wondered whether I lacked artistic capacity. But I do respect the craft. I can appreciate the juxtapositions, the rhythm, the scale. It was an experience.
